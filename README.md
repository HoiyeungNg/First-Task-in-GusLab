## 2020.04.02 8:50 a.m. to 
### Since I didn't tried to reproduce papers, I learned some experience from [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/c6f2rj/how_to_reproduce_papers/) etc.
## 2020.04.02 9.18 a.m. to 10:05a.m.
### Look through the essay and get the structure etc.
## 2020 04.04 10:30 a.m. to 12:00 3:00 p.m. to 5:55 p.m. 
### 终于有整块的时间，今天只做一件事。
## 2020 04.07 9:40 p.m. to midnignt
### Begin focusing on network sci and topology To understand some terms 'fully connected graph structure' 'hamiltonian walk' 'mixed effect model'
## 2020 04.09 6:00 a.m. to 11:50 p.m.
### Modeling
## 2020.04.15 11:00 a.m. to 11:55 a.m.
### To understand some terms 'graph leaning' 'Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient' 'Clustering Coefficient'
## 2020.04.19 09:00 a.m. to 9:55 a.m.
### Further Reading on 'linear mixed model' Maybe try Stata later on.
